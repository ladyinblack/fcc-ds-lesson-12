### [Create complex multi-dimensional arrays](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-data-structures/create-complex-multi-dimensional-arrays)

## HINT:
- The first string - `deep` - must be inserted three levels deep.  This means within exactly three sets of `[square-brackets]`.
```js
let threeLevelArray = [
  "first level",
  ["Two levels deep", ["Three levels deep"]]
];
```
- 2. Using this logic insert strings `deep`, `deeper` and `deepest`, in the matrix three levels deep, four levels deep and five levels deep respectively.
